            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In this A/B testing project, we aim to understand the underlying statistics of A/B tests on websites. For this assignment, we have made a minor change to a static HTML website and tested how this small change affects user interactions. A/B testing allows us to perform quantitative analysis on user behavior and understand the impact of design changes. Our goal is to measure how this change influences users performing a specific task: scheduling an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024.</p>

            <h2>Changes Made</h2>
            <p>I changed the 'schedule appointment' buttons to light blue to make them easier to see and make the interaction more clear. I also changed the title of the table to "Schedule an Appointment Below" so users are more clear on what they have to do. Below is a screenshot of the modified webpage:</p>

                        <p>Lower mouse movement distance may indicate improved user experience, suggesting that the design change has made it easier for users to navigate the website. The alternative hypothesis implies that Version B's design leads to a more efficient user experience. Since our original alpha is 0.05, the low p-value indicates that the observed difference in mouse movement distance between the versions is statistically significant.I predict that the design changes in version B will lead to a significant reduction in mouse movement distance compared to version A, indicating a more efficient user experience.</p>

                        <p>Since the color of ‘schedule appointment’ is now highlighted, I think it will be easier for users to find the correct button to press to schedule the appointment. Therefore, the misclick rate will differ. A lower misclick rate suggests that users are interacting more accurately with the website, indicating an improvement in usability. The alternative hypothesis suggests that the design changes have positively influenced user interaction. Since our original alpha is 0.05, the low p-value suggests that the difference in misclick rates between the versions is statistically significant. I anticipate that the highlighted 'schedule appointment' button in version B will lead to a decreased misclick rate compared to version A, reflecting improved user interaction and usability, supported by the statistically significant difference indicated by the low p-value.

                        <p>Since the title has changed to be clearer, a user will understand that the primary screen they’re on is to schedule an appointment. Therefore, it should be quicker to schedule an appointment. A lower time on page indicates that users are spending less time to complete the task, suggesting improved usability and clarity of design. The alternative hypothesis implies that Version B's design leads to quicker task completion. Since our original alpha is 0.05, the low p-value indicates that the observed difference in time on page between the versions is statistically significant.I expect that the clearer title in version B will result in a reduction in time on page compared to version A, indicating faster task completion and improved usability, supported by the statistically significant difference highlighted by the low p-value.</p>

                <h3>Misclick Rate</h3>
                <p>Test Used: Chi-Squared Test<br>

                p-Value: 0.01<br>
                The high chi-squared value indicates a significant deviation in misclicks between the two versions. Since the p-value is less than our alpha level of 0.05, we find statistically significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we are confident that the alternative hypothesis is true, indicating that the misclick rates are different between versions A and B.</p>

                p-Value: 0.000000001<br>
                The extremely low p-value indicates a statistically significant difference in time on page between the two versions. Since the p-value is much less than our alpha level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and find statistically significant evidence that Version B has a lower time on page than Version A. We are confident that the alternative hypothesis is true.</p>

                The high t-score and low p-value indicate a significant difference in mouse movement distance between the versions. Given that the p-value is less than our alpha level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and find statistically significant evidence that the mouse movement distances are different between versions A and B. We are confident that the alternative hypothesis is true.</p>

                        </ul>
                        These statistics suggest that users are spending a considerable amount of time on the page, which could indicate potential usability issues or content complexity. The variance indicates the spread of the data points around the mean.

                        </ul>
                        The lower mean and median time on page for Version B suggest that users are spending less time on the page, which could indicate improved usability and clarity of design. The higher variance indicates a wider spread of data points around the mean.

                        The mean and median mouse movement distance for Version A are relatively high, indicating a potentially higher cognitive load or difficulty in navigation. The variance suggests a wide distribution of mouse movement distances.

                        The significantly lower mean and median mouse movement distance for Version B suggest that users are experiencing less cognitive load and smoother navigation. The lower variance indicates a more consistent user experience in terms of mouse movement.
